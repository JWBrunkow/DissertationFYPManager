**How to get the registration page running.**
To get the registration page running on a container on local, you have to add a hostname to host file.

To do this on Windows, run notepad application as an adminstrator. Once open click on file then open, navigate to
your C: drive and onto this path C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc. Once in this path open up select 'All Files'
instead of 'Text Documents (*.txt)' at the bottom right corner. A file named 'hosts' should appear at the top of the list.
Open hosts, and then add '127.0.0.2 	php-docker.local' on an uncommented line without the '#' symbol at the begining 
of the line.
Save host file.

To test that this is working type 'ping php-docker.local' on comanad line and should get reply back from 127.0.0.2

Run the docker-compose up command in terminal and navigate to php-docker.local:8080 in your browser. The page should now load
and work as intended.


**HOW DOES PROJECT REGISTRATION FRONT-END WORK?**
The project registration page runs on a php webserver which post form inputs into a json file.

***The steps for registering for a project is as follows:***
1) Users have to enter their name, login and degree programme in the inputs provided respectively. 
2) If a project needs special resources, users can click the checkbox to indicate so. Doing so
   will open a text box for them to input the resources they want.
3) If a project requires ethics approval, users can click on the checkbox to indicate so. Doing so
   will open a textbox for them to enter a brief description of the project and how human participants are involved.
   It will also show a button which will take them to the ethics checklist service (will be implemented later).
4) Once all of that is complete, they can click on the submit button to send the form of the supervisor to sign.


**TECHNOLOGY USED**
Bootstrap for styling and jQuery library for JavaScript. Both Bootstrap and jQuery uses CDN (A content delivery network) versions 
rather than locally installed. This means provided we're connected online we would be using the latest versions
of both.

**WHY BOOTSTRAP?**
Bootstrap provides us with an easier and efficient way of styling html elements. It also allows us
to easily build responsive websites/app.

**WHY JQUERY?**
jQuery makes allows us easily use JavaScript on the project. It simplifies many line of JS code in some 
cases into a one-line code. This is possible with its many prewritten methods available to us.

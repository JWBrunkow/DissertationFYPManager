TECHNOLOGY USED
Bootstrap for styling and jQuery library for JavaScript. Both Bootstrap and jQuery uses CDN (A content delivery network) versions 
rather than locally installed. This means provided we're connected online we would be using the latest versions
of both.

WHY BOOTSTRAP?
Bootstrap provides us with an easier and efficient way of styling html elements. It also allows us
to easily build responsive websites/app.

WHY JQUERY?
jQuery makes allows us easily use JavaScript on the project. It simplifies many line of JS code in some 
cases into a one-line code. This is possible with its many prewritten methods available to us.

HOW DOES PROJECT REGISTRATION FRONT-END WORK?
The steps for registering for a project is as follows:
1) Users have to enter their name, login and degree programme in the inputs provided respectively. 
2) Then click the add button to add a student to the registration form. This will bring up a table
   with the details of the student entered. Multiple users can be added to the table for a group project.
   If any one of the input is empty, then a red text askes the user to enter details.
3) If a project needs special resources, users can click the checkbox to indicate so. Doing so
   will open a text box for them to input the resources they want.
4) If a project requires ethics approval, users can click on the checkbox to indicate so. Doing so
   will open a textbox for them to enter a brief description of the project and how human participants are involved.
   It will also show a button which will take them to the ethics checklist service (will be implemented later).
5) Once all of that is complete, they can click on the submit button to send the form of the supervisor to sign.
